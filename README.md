# Library

# Issues with Current Design
1. In an emergency, the emergency button does not stand out as much as it should.
2. Not all buttons light up after clicking them
3. Determining the difference between G and M
4. If you do not attend Texas Tech or do not go to the library often, how would you know what they S stood for?

# How is this design good?
1. Can clearly tell which button belongs to which text.
2. You get a response when you click on the buttons

# Common Things Used in An Elevator
1. The levels of the building
2. The open and close button

  I believe the interface does a good job at making these easier and not too hard to find. There is a gap between the levels and the 
  open and close buttons, so it makes it stand out.
  
# Common Sequence of Actions
1. User gets on the elevator
2. User decides which level he/she would like to go to
3. User presses on the close doors button

  The elevator does provide feekback in that it makes a noise when a button is pressed. Not only that, but it also lights up the
  circle next to it.
  
# Common Mistakes
1. Thinking M is the first level and not G
